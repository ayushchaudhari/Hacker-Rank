Problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insertionsort1/problem


Data Structures Used-
1. String
2. Vector of Integer

Main Inbuilt Functions used-
1. push_back() -  to push elements to the vector
2. stoi() - converts string to integer

Terminologies - 
Insertion Sort - Insertion Sort is a type of sorting based on comparison and swaps. It has time complexity of n^2.
Insertion sort works as per its name, it sorts the array at the time of insertion of the element only.

Example - to sort given array using insertion sort
array - [1,2,4,5,6,3]
1. We will keep checking if each element is less than it next or not.
2. If the current element is greater than next element then it means the next element must come before current element.
3. So we save the next element as key and we shift current element to the next position.
4. And we do this shifting of every element before the current till we get the correct position for the key(i.e. where key >element).
1,2,4,5,6,6 key=3
1,2,4,5,5,6 key=3
1,2,4,4,5,6 key=3
1,2,3,4,5,6 sorted

---------------------------LOGIC----------------------------------
Pseudo Code - 
1. for every element in arr

2. check if current element > next element
2.1 if true 
	2.1.1 store key= next element and j= current position
	
	2.1.2 check every element from position j to 0 that i.e. while(arr[j]>key) if true just push the arr[j] at next position i.e. arr[j+1]=arr[j] and decrement j.
	
	2.1.3 when we come out of while loop it means arr[j]<key i.e. we got the correct position of key. So store key @ arr[j+1].

2.2 if false do not do anything as it is already sorted

That's it!
