Problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/strong-password/problem

Data Structures Used-
1. String
2. Vector of Boolean used as flags to check whether the password satisfies the given condition

Main Inbuilt Functions used-
1. stoi() - converts string to integer
2. size() - to get size of vector and string
3. getline() - used to get the text input from txt file


Terminologies - 
As per problem the password should have -
// length 6 or greater
// password should contain -
// 1 digit ("0123456789")
// 1 lowercase ("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
// 1 uppercase ("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")
// 1 special character ("!@#$%^&*()-+")

---------------------------LOGIC----------------------------------
1. Make a vector of type boolean which acts as a flag. The vector should by default contain 4 flags initialized as false. 4 flags are used to check whether the password has a digit, a lowercase, a uppercase & a special case.

2. for each char in string password check if it has a digit, a lowercase, a uppercase, a special case character or not if it has set the respective flag to true.

3. for each flag in flags vector if anywhere the flag is false it means the criteria of password is not fulfilled so I increment a variable changes which is initialially 0.

4. Now if the password_size < 6 & changes < (6- password_size) then set changes to 6-n as the first criteria is to make the password of 6 characters first.

5. Return changes

That's it!
