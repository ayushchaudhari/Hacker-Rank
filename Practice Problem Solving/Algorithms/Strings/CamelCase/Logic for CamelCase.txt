Problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/camelcase/problem

Data Structures Used-
1. String

Main Inbuilt Functions used-
1. push_back() - to push in string
2. getline()- to take the whole string input in one line
3. size() - to get the size of the string 


---------------------------LOGIC----------------------------------
Just iterate over the full string and if the current letter is greater than or same as A and less than or same as Z then it should be considered as the starting of the word that means there is a word. So add 1 to the words variable.
So total capital letters in the string is the number of words and 1 word is starting as given which does'nt start with capital letter so return word+1 as we have to consider that word also.

Pseudo Code of camel case function - 
1. words=0

2. Iterate over each character of the string
2.1. if string[i]>='A' or string[i]<='Z' then
2.1.1. increment words by 1

3. return words+1

That's it!
