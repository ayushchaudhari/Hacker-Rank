Problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/two-characters

Data Structures Used-
1. String
2. Vector
3. Set - to store unqiue chars from the given string


Main Inbuilt Functions used-
1. push_back() - to push in string
2. getline()- to take the whole string input in one line 
3. max(a,b) - to get maximum of a & b
4. set.insert() - to insert elements into set
5. iterators(begin(), end()) - to iterate in set


---------------------------LOGIC----------------------------------
Steps - 
1. Extract unique chars from the given string.
2. There are 2 ways either you can make the combination of element you have to delete or you can make combination you have to keep to make the longest possible alternate character string.
3. As the combination for element to be delete can change as per the number of unique chars so I choose to make combination of characters to keep in longest possible alternate string as it will be contains combinations that always have 2 chars, so it is easy to make.
4. So I made all possible selections/combinations in which each selections/combination contains 2 unique chars.
5. So just after that I made all possible strings considering each selection at a time(i.e. selecting 2 chars at a time) and kept checking whether they are longest possible alternate string or not.
6. At last returned maximum string length. 

That's it!
