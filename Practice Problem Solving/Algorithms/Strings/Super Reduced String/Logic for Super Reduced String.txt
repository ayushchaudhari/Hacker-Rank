Problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/reduced-string/problem

Data Structures Used-
1. String

Main Inbuilt Functions used-
1. push_back() - to push in string
2. getline()- to take the whole string input in one line 


---------------------------LOGIC----------------------------------
Steps - 
1. For every character in the string(So just iterate over the full string) - 
1.1 check if current element is same as its next element or not. If the element is same as the next one then increment the iterator of for loop by 1 else store the element in the result string which has to printed at last.

2. Now after this there are 3 case either we get the final result string, or we can get a empty string or there is one more case that we get a string that can be further minimized as per the given condition of minimization or reduction.

So, to tackle this we have to check the result string again over the same algorithm, so that it reduces the string as much as it can be. So for this I have done it using the recursion. I called the function recursiverly.
But there is case when we have to do the above step, the condition is the result string should not be empty and the result string should not be same as that of the original/raw inputted string(that is given to the function as parameter).

3. If the result_str=="" i.e result string is empty then directly return "Empty String" or Store result string in "Empty String" and then later return it.

4. Return the result_str.
 

That's it!
