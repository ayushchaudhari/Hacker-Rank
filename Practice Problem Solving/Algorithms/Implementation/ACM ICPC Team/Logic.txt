Logic for problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/acm-icpc-team/problem -

Now in this problem we just have to find the maximum count of known topics/subjects by any two person team and how many ways we can make the team having knowledge of maximum topics.
So what I did is I just got a sense that if one out of 2 person knows the topic its counted or also if both knows the topic then also it is counted but the topic that is not known by anyone is not counted.
Then I just used the above given condition for every subjects/topics on each 2 person team possible as per permutation.
So just what I did is I kept storing the count of subjects known for every 2 person team that was possible as per permutation. And keeping the track of maximum known subjects by any team at the same time. 
Then just at last as we have found above the maximum number of subjects known so just I found that how many teams has there known subjects/topics count equal to maximum count, so that is the number of teams possible which must have that maximum count of topics known.
So yeah we have found max count of known subjects by a 2 player team and also the number of team that are having that count.
