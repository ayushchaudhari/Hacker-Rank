Logic for problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/taum-and-bday/problem

So just before explaining the logic see the terms used in question given below-
b- number of black gifts
b- number of white gifts
bc- cost of 1 black gift
wc- cost of 1 white gift
z- cost of converting either from b to w or w to b

Output we have to give is- minimum amount of units Taum needs to spend on gifts.

So I found in the explaination given in the question that still if we convert a gift from b to w (i.e black to white) the cost will be z+wc i.e converting cost + cost of white and vice versa.
So what I get from this is if cost of black gift b i.e. bc is greater than the cost of wc+z(i.e bc>wc+z) then we should convert the b to w gift else we should buy the b gift at bc price itself. And this same goes when converting from w to b i.e for conveting w gift to b gift we should have bc+z<wc.
So just this guys convert this logic to code by returning the total cost= (b*min(bc,wc+z))+(w*min(wc,bc+z)).
