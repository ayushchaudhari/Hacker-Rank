Logic for problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/lisa-workbook/problem


Data Structures Used-
1. String
2. Vector of String
3. Vector of Integer

Main Inbuilt Functions used-
1. ceil(a) - round off the value to smallest integer greater than a
2. push_back() - to push char in string and string in vector_of_string
3. stoi({string})- converts string to integer
4. getline()- to take the whole string input in one line

1. Just the idea is to find the total special_problems just by finding the total number of pages required by a chapter and then checking if any problem number on that page is equal to the current page or not.

2. So what I did is first I executed for loop as we have to do the above step for each chapter so we execute the for loop for n chapters given.

3. And for each chapter we find the number of pages required for the problems of the ongoing chapter. And it is easy to find that using as we can have only k problems on an page so through this hint try finding it. 

4. Then just in this loop just you have to think over couple of conditions to check weather any problem numbers on an page is equal to the page number or not. If yes then increase special_problems by 1 else continue checking the same for problems on next pages.

That's it!
