Logic for problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/service-lane/problem


Data Structures Used-
1. String
2. Vector of String
3. Vector of Integer

Main Inbuilt Functions used-
1. stoi({string})- converts string to integer
2. push_back() - to push char in string and string in vector_of_string
3. min(a,b)- returns the minimum value in a and b
4. getline()- to take the whole string input in one line

1. This is not a difficult problem or that kind of problem on which you have to think so much. Its easy.

2. So as we are given with the different width of the service lane in an vector and t test cases and each test case comprise of 2 indexes i,j and and we have to do everything b/w them.

3. So we have to find the maximum width vehicle which can easily pass through all width of service lane for a certain test case(each test case has i & j in between them we have to do this).

4. From 3rd point we get that, the service lane with lowest width between i to j(given) is the maximum width of the vehicle which can go through whole service lane.

5. Just do the above steps for t test cases and keep pushing the minimum width of respective test case each time.

6. At last just return the vector having minimum_width of vehicle which can go through.

That's it!
