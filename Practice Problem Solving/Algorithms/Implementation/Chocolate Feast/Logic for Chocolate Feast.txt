Logic for problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/chocolate-feast/problem


All DS and inbuilt functions which are given below are used to take inputs only no need of them to define the "Chocolate Feast" function.
Data Structure used-
1. String
2. Vector of Strings

Inbuilt Function used in function-
1. getline()- to take inputs
2. stoi()- to convert string inputs to integer
3. push_back()- to push string in vector of strings

1. Initially in first time we buy chocolate as per the amount(n) we have and that much only wrappers we would have initially.

2. Than now as we have already invested our full amount(n) which we have initially in buying some chocolates.
So now onwards we would only get the chocolates in exchange of chocolate wrappers as we do not have any amount now.

3. So what I did is for each time when I have wrappers>=m(m is exchange amount of wrappers), I exhanged them to buy chocolates.
3.1 So I added the total chocolate that I can get in exchange of that much wrappers.
3.2 And I kept decreasing wrappers by subtracting wrappers invested from the wrappers & increase the wrapper as we have buyed some chocolates.
i.e.- wrapper=wrapper-(chocolate_buy_in_exchange*m)+chocolate_buy_in_exchange
which can also be given as-> wrapper+=(chocolate_buy_in_exchange*(1-m))

4. So at last just return the total of chocolates we have buyed.

Just That!
