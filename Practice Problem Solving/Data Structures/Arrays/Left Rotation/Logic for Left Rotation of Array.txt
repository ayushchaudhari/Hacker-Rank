Problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/array-left-rotation/problem

Data Structures Used-
1. String
2. Vector


Main Inbuilt Functions used-
1. push_back() - to push in string
2. getline()- to take the whole string input in one line 

---------------------------LOGIC----------------------------------
Just instead of rotating array left selecting one element at a time and inserting it at the back, I have just changed the starting index of the array which does the same work in O(1) of time is needed.
Just do this.

So what I actually did is- 
Example - lets take an example of given array in test case -
n=5 d=4 and array = {1,2,3,4,5}
So instead of actually rotating the array, I just changed the index from where I print the resultant array.

Algorithm Steps:

1. I first do d=d%n because if the left rotation=n, then if we actually think we do not have to actually rotate the array. As after rotating also its same.
Or if we consider 6 left moves then actually is same as when we rotate the array left by 6%5=1 move.
So I would suggest do this before actually doing anything.

2. After that we just print the whole array starting from that d to n & then 0 to d-1. Which actually means whole circular array from index d to d-1.

Just that!!!
