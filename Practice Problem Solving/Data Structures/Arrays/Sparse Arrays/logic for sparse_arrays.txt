Problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sparse-arrays/problem

Data Structures Used-
1. Map
2. String
3. Vector

Main Inbuilt Functions used-
1. getline()- to take the whole string input in one line 
2. map.find() -  to find the key in map or not
3. map.insert() - to insert the pair in map
4. make_pair() - to make the pair, so that it can be inserted into the map

I thought of solving this question with O(n^2) of time complexity first which is easy way but a very time complex way to solve this.
But the better way which I could thought of which is also a less time complex way to solve this problem is by using MAP we can solve this.
Just store the every string in map while taking the input keeping string as key and its count as value which will be initially 1. If the string as a key already exists, than increment its counter by 1.
After this take queries input normally. 
For each query in queries check if the string already exists in the map or not. If it exists than the count shall be the value present @ that key in map. If not exists then just consider 0 as count for that. Save all this count in another result array/vector.
Return the result vector

Just that!!!
