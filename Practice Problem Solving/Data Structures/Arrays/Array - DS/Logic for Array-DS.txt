Problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/arrays-ds/problem

Data Structures Used-
1. String
2. Vector

Main Inbuilt Functions used-
1. push_back() - to push in int in vector
2. getline()- to take whole line input in one line
3. stoi() - converts string to integer
4. size() - returns the size of vector & string

Terminology - 
The problem is based on the concept of reversing a array/vector.
For example - arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
after reversing the arr should be - {5,4,3,2,1}

---------------------------LOGIC----------------------------------
-> Simply to reverse a array we will iterate the given array elements in reverse direction i.e. from backwards or we can say from last elements.
-> So we iterate the arr(shown above in terminology section) from 5->4->3->2->1 like this.
-> And while iterating from the last to first element we will keep appending the element in the new vector named rev_vector.

Pseudo Code - 
1. declare rev_vector.
2. for i in range of a.size()-1 to 0 (both inclusive) keep decrementing i and append arr[i] to rev_vector.
3. return rev_vector.

That's it!
