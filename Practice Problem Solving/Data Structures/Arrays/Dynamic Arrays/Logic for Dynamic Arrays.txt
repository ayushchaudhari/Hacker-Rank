Problem @ https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/dynamic-array

Data Structures Used-
1. String
2. Vector

Main Inbuilt Functions used-
1. push_back()
2. getline()- to take the whole string input in one line 

---------------------------LOGIC----------------------------------
The logic is pretty simple just the language of question is so confusing!!
1. Just we have to make a 2D array of size n containing n empty 1D arrays.

2. Initialize lastAnswer with 0

3. Declare Answers array/vector

2. So there are 2 types of queries and for every query on the basis of its type we have to perform this till each query is executed- 
2.1 query 1 - 1 a b
2.1.1 initialize; idx = ((a^lastAns)%n)  {^ represents XOR in code}
2.1.2 Append b @ arr[idx] i.e. push_back in 1D array present at idx.

2.2 query 2 - 2 a b
2.2.1 initialize; idx=((a^lastAns)%n)
2.2.2 Assign lastAns as arr[idx][b % arr[idx].size()]
i.e. lastAns = arr[idx][b % arr[idx].size()]
2.2.2 Append the lastAns to Answers array.

3. Return the Answers array at last.

That's it!
